<b>Thank you for supporting Loom over the past five years.</b>

<p>At the start of a project, the twists and turns ahead are unmapped. We are pleased to announce that Loom has been acquired by <a href="http://blackstormlabs.com/">Blackstorm Labs</a>. As part of this, the Loom SDK online presence is being wound down. Don't worry - all existing licenses are valid and will remain in force. The publicly available <a href="http://github.com/LoomSDK/">source code</a> will remain public under its existing license.</p>

<p>The Loom SDK has been <a href="http://theengine.co/">The Engine Company</a>'s focus since inception, but the time has come to move on. <a href="http://theengine.co/">The Engine Company</a> will continue to serve existing clients.</p>

<p>You can contact <i>support AT theengine DOT co</i> with any Loom related inquiries.</p>
